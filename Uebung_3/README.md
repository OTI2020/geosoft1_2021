### Instructions for embedding the key
=======

On this HTML page you can determine the wheather in your location.
To do that, you have to insert your API-Key into the small textarea and press the "run" button.
After running the code, a small table will appeare below the textarea, in which you can see all the necessary information about your local wheather.
Please note, that you insert your right API-Key, otherwise the code cannot run properly.
KÃ¤se :)
