This is my solution of task 4!
## Task
Create a leaflet map for this purpose.
This map should represent a layer containing the route from Route_Exercise4.geojson
https://leafletjs.com/examples.html
Extends the map with the Leaflet draw function. The user should now have the possibility to draw a bounding box (rectangular polygon
as in task 1).
Each point where the route intersects the new polygon (crosses the boundary of the polygon) should be determined and displayed as a
Leaflet marker on the map.
For these points a query for the weather should be made using the api from task 3. This
weather data should be displayed as a pop-up on the leaflet map for each associated pin.
